Three different clock sources can be used to drive the system clock (SYSCLK):

  ● HSI oscillator clock

  ● HSE oscillator clock

  ● PLL clock

The devices have the following two secondary clock sources:

  ● 40 kHz low speed internal RC (LSI RC) which drives the independent watchdog and optionally the RTC used for Auto-wakeup from Stop/Standby mode.

  ● 32.768 kHz low speed external crystal (LSE crystal) which optionally drives the realtime clock (RTCCLK)

Each clock source can be switched on or off independently when it is not used, to optimize power consumption.

  ● Offset : 0x00

  ● Reset  : 0x0000_XX83
